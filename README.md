## Daily Holiday Finder
Everyone loves holidays - they are great days to spend with family and forget about the troubles of life for a bit. But how many holidays do you actually know about? Almost every day, a country around the world is celebrating something!

Whether you are simply planning your next trip or trying to advertise your new product to the most amount of people who aren't at work on a given day, you can use our data feature to help you along the way!

This feature lists the countries celebrating holidays today, what holiday they are celebrating, and the population of those countries.

## API Selection
* [Nager.Date](https://date.nager.at/Api) - Public Holidays API
* [Rest Countries](https://restcountries.com/#about-this-project) - Country Info API

We chose Nager because it gives access to an out of the box ready to use API that lists information about public holidays in over 90 countries.

We also chose to use Rest Countries because it provides access to info about each country from its country code. It is especially nice since it does not require an API key.

## How to Use the Feature
Run the notebook and it will tell you what holidays are occurring today. It will also tell you where those holidays are celebrated and the total number of people celebrating them.


## Setup
No setup! Just give it a run :)
